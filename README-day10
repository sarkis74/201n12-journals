Today I learned more about CSS layouts. We were assigned re-reading of chapter on this topic and went over this in class. I learned about default CSS setitngs and the CSS reset file. I also leared more about Javascript forms and how to attach event-listeners to targets in HTML and how they function on the webpage. I have difficulty discerning parent-child hierarchy and planning out how to apply object methods to HTML elements.
