The journals helped me go over my thoughts and how to reconfigure them in different ways. By this I mean that somethimes my memories are jumbled. The journals helped me organize these memories. Therefore they were also helful in refreshing what I learned during the day. I was able to go over what I learned and if I had trouble explaining what I learned because it was something I had difficulty understanding, writing in the journal facilitated comprehension.
