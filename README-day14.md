Today I learned how to retain data on a chart after the page has been refreshed. I also learned about the "curl" terminal command from one of the TAs and how to use it upload images. I improved my DOM knowledge by repeatedly fixing "cannot append null" errors. I also improve my knowledge of functions and objects. I still have difficulty grasping the prototype property of objects. I know that this property inherits everything from the original and can be used for "add-ons" to them. I just gaging when to use them and why. 
As for Imposter Syndrome I would rate myself at about an 8. I feel I'm too old to learn new skills and that I'm lagging way behind others. It scares me when I feel I can't grasp what others easily can.
